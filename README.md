# TutorCruncher intern test

To complete this test you need to:
* Fork this repo
* clone your fork so you have a local copy of the code
* get the app up and running locally (hint: you need to install the requirements in `requirements.txt`, the code should
  run with either python 2.7 or 3.4)
* complete the app so:
  * the order form is complete including a preview of how much the product costs.
  * it validates the order form, then either: returns an error, or redirects to the confirmation page
  * it makes the necessary calculations to complete the confirmation page
  * if you complete the rest of the test quickly, you might want to add another page to list orders by date created
* create an appropriately pull request to the main repo with your changes.
* please try and make the project PEP8 complaint, we have a much better time reviewing it.

Most of the actually coding here is pretty simple, the only mildly tricking thing is calculating the optimal 
denominations of money to give change in.

If you're familiar with the technologies used here this should take you well under an hour. However if you haven't 
worked much with html, javascript, flask or python before it might take you longer. How long you choose to spend is up
to you, but this is similar to the stack we use at TutorCruncher so if you want to come for an internship with us
this is the kind of thing you'll need to understand or learn quickly.

Even if you don't end up coming and doing an internship with us you'll probably learn a lot by completing the test.

**Good luck.**
